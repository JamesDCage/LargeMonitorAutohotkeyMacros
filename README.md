# LargeMonitorAutohotkeyMacros

Every AHK programmer probably has a set of window placement macros. These are mine.

These were designed to work with a very large, 4k resolution, single monitor. The windows are either horizontal 3x4 or vertical "golden ratio" windows.

I spend most of my time working in the "sweet spot" of a 55" monitor - that is, the center. Multi-monitor arrangements often put two bezels in the center of the workspace. Using a large single monitor avoids this.

I also have top/bottom and left/right arrangements to put workspaces side-by side. The side-by-side arrangments do not completely overlap with the main windows, allowing me to quickly switch between 7-8 different windows.

Side-by-side arrangements overlap slightly, making it easy to select window borders. (Placing two windows exactly side by side makes it difficult to reliably select a window border, as you're never exactly sure whether Windows will select the left or right window, for example.)
